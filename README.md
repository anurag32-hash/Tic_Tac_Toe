## Problem

Write a MIPS Assembly Program to emulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also called noughts and crosses.
It is a two-player game, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player
who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical or diagonal row is the winner.
The game can also return in a tie.

## Input

Your program should take player inputs from the console and take the decision based on the inputs
from both the players. The code should check if the input is a valid input after each turn.

## Output

The program should print the final board and the outcome (Winner or Tie).
