## Problem
Write a MIPS Assembly Program for comparing two matrices using Root Mean Square Error.

## Input
 2 matrices of size 3x3 stored in the memory. The matrices can have any random integer values.

## Output 
The root mean square difference between the two matrices should be stored in the memory. The code should print the result.
